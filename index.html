	    International Workshop on Arm-based HPC: Practice and Experience (IWAHPCE-2025)</div><br>
	    &nbsp;<br>
	  to be held in conjunction with The International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region (<a href="https://event1.nchc.org.tw/hpcasia2025/">HPC Asia 2025</a>), Hsinchu, Taiwan, Feb.19-21, 2025.<br>

	  <div class="subtitle">Workshop Overview</div>
This workshop aims to provide the opportunity to share the practice and experience of high-performance computing systems using the Arm architecture and their performance and applications.The last few years have seen an explosion of 64-bit Arm-based processors targeted toward server and infrastructure workloads, often specializing in a specific domain such as HPC, cloud, and machine learning. Fujitsu’s A64FX and Marvell’s ThunderX2 have been used in several large-scale HPC systems, and Amazon’s Graviton2 has been adopted by Amazon EC2. Moreover, Amazon’s Graviton3, NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, and SiPearl’s Rhea system-on-chip are recently announced or become accessible.Sharing the practice and experiences using these Arm-based processors will contribute to advancing high-performance computing technology for newly designed systems using these new emerging Arm-based processors.<br><br>
